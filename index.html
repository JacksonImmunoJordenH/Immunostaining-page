            <p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Immunofluorescence immunostaining are powerful techniques, indispensable in research and in clinical diagnostics. They are a staple of the pathology lab for disease diagnostics and classification. In research, Immunostaining techniques are used to interrogate many biological processes, including visualization of protein expression patterns, characterization of protein interactions, and identification of tissue boundaries. The researcher can thereby observe the distribution and localization of specific structures within the context of the cellular architecture.</p>

            <h2 id="principles">Principles of Immunostaining</h2>

            <p>A tissue analyte is specifically recognized by a primary antibody, which may be directly conjugated (direct immunostaining); or the primary may itself be detected by a conjugated secondary antibody (indirect immunostaining), allowing visualization of the analyte. The conjugated antibody can be labeled with any of several reporter molecules, including enzymes, fluorophores and colloidal gold. The expression of multiple analytes can be observed and characterized by individual primary/secondary antibody pairs in multiple labeling protocols.</p>

            <h3>Direct or Indirect Immunostaining</h3>
            <p>Analytes of interest may be detected on the surface of the tissue or interrogated internally through permeabilization of the sample. The analyte (antigen) can be detected directly (Figure 2 A), or indirectly (Figure 2 B) using a fluorescent (immunofluorescence) or reporter enzyme (colorimetric) probe conjugated to a secondary antibody.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/img/static-pages/fig33.jpg" alt="Depiction of the 3 detection methods for Immunohistochemistry">
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <strong>A</strong> Direct Immunostaining, <strong>B</strong> Indirect Immunostaining, <strong>C</strong> Signal enhancement with biotinylated secondary and labeled streptavidin </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The indirect method using a secondary antibody offers many advantages. It preserves the antigen binding site on the primary antibody by conjugating to the secondary antibody. Since secondary antibodies are available conjugated to a wide variety of fluorophores, the indirect method enhances the possibilities for multiple labeling. In addition, it provides inherent signal enhancement, whereby multiple secondary antibodies bind to one antigen-bound primary antibody. Signal can be further enhanced by using a biotinylated secondary antibody followed by conjugated streptavidin (Figure 2 C), or by using the <a href="/technical/products/groups/pap">peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) method</a>.</p>

            <h3>Designing the indirect Immunostaining protocol</h3>

            <p>Factors that contribute to the success of an experiment are the tissue of interest, primary antibody choice, secondary antibody specificity, and options for signal detection. Proper blocking assures optimal signal-to-noise ratio, and control proteins aid in the interpretation of results.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="tissue">Tissue or sample specifics</h2>

            <h3>Tissue Species</h3>

            <p>The source (species) of experimental sample will influence the choice of antibodies. Certain tissue types contain endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig), and others exhibit vasculature in which remnant blood may provide endogenous Ig. For indirect immunostaining, the secondary antibody must recognize the specific primary antibody but not endogenous Ig. It is most convenient to use a primary antibody that is derived from a different host animal than the tissue of interest: in this case select a secondary antibody that has been cross-adsorbed (min X) to minimize recognition of endogenous Ig. If the experimental strategy includes using a primary antibody from the same host species as the tissue of interest, endogenous Ig can be masked by blocking with monovalent Fab fragments of secondary antibodies. It is also possible to label primary antibodies with Fab fragments prior to incubation with the sample.</p>

            <p><a href="/technical/products/groups/fab">Read more about Fab fragment secondary antibodies.</a></p>

            <h3>Fixation</h3>

            <p>Tissue fixation is the process of stabilizing and preserving a specimen in a configuration that approximates its natural state. As the innate aqueous environment is altered by chemical fixation, an antigenic site may be modified so that it cannot be recognized by a primary antibody that would detect its native state. Many primary antibodies are marketed as “validated” to perform under specified fixation conditions, though this information may not be available. In some cases, antigen retrieval protocols can return antigenic sites to their native state.</p>

            <div class="box-note">
                <p><strong>Note</strong> that the concept of antibodies validated to perform in immunostaining is unique to primary antibodies. If a primary antibody binds its target site, a labeled secondary antibody will bind to it regardless of tissue fixation. </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Intrinsic signal</h3>

            <p>Tissue samples may reveal several types of intrinsic signal. Autofluorescence (signal in the absence of fluorescent probe molecules) may be evident in some regions of the spectrum. When planning an immunofluorescent protocol, observe an unlabeled tissue sample using available filter sets. Choose fluorophores that are compatible with spectral regions that have limited autofluorescence. It is possible to suppress autofluorescence with various reagents, though the efficiency of these treatments varies depending on both tissue type and fixation method.</p>

            <p>Intrinsic signal may also derive from endogenous enzymes and/or biotin. To test for and control these types of background signal, see our <a href="/secondary-antibody-resource/technical-tips/controls-diluents-blocking/">Blocking and Controls guide</a>.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="primary">Primary antibody choice for Immunostaining</h2>

            <h3>Target</h3>

            <p>The primary antibody should recognize the protein of interest under the intended experimental conditions. Some primary antibodies have been validated for use under specific conditions, e.g. fixation methods. An antibody that has been validated only for Western blotting may not be appropriate for immunostaining.</p>

            <h3>Monoclonal or polyclonal</h3>

            <p>Polyclonal antibodies recognize multiple epitopes, maximizing the opportunity for the antibody to detect the antigen, but may result in detection of homologous proteins and lead to background signal. Monoclonal antibodies consist of identical immunoglobulin molecules produced from a single cell line, and are appropriate when the detection needs are epitope specific. However, they may give a weaker signal than polyclonals. Controls can be used to help determine the suitability of antibodies for each assay system.</p>

            <h3>Host species of the primary antibody</h3>

            <p>Ideally, the host species of the primary antibody should be a different species from the sample species to avoid cross-reactivity with endogenous proteins. If the primary antibody and the tissue of interest are the same species, <a href="/technical/products/protocols/double-labeling-same-species-primary">blocking protocols can be used to prevent off-target signal</a>.</p>

            <h3>Detecting multiple targets</h3>

            <p>Multiple labeling is used for the detection of more than one analyte in the same assay. Primary antibodies derived from different species, or mouse monoclonal antibodies of different subclasses, are optimal choices for multiple labeling. If these choices are unavailable, multiple labeling can be achieved through special strategies.</p>

            <a href="/technical/products/protocols/multiple-labeling">Read more about multiple labeling</a>

            <h3>Antibody optimization</h3>

            <p>Primary antibodies may detect the target protein satisfactorily for one experimental protocol, but not work as well under different conditions. It is good practice to optimize and therefore validate the antibody each time the experimental conditions are altered, for example, when the tissue type is changed or a different secondary antibody detection system is used.</p>

            <h3>Detection</h3>

            <p>Analytes can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope by using a fluorescent conjugate, or under a light microscope by using an enzyme conjugate followed by a chromogenic substrate (colorimetric detection). Detection by light microscopy is also possible using silver enhancement of a colloidal gold antibody.</p>

            <p>Each detection method can offer advantages, in terms of sensitivity, quantification, cost-per-assay or capacity for detection of multiple analytes. Table 1 below compares the two detection methods.</p>

            <h3>Colorimetric detection</h3>

            <p>Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugates can be used for colorimetric detection. Colorimetric detection can offer quick and easily obtained results, with excellent detection sensitivity. Multiple analyte detection can be achieved by using different chromogens in sequential incubations.</p>

            <h3>Blocking reagents</h3>

            <p>Blocking steps can dramatically improve results and simplify analysis of IHC experiments. To avoid unexpected signal from non-specific, conserved sequence and/or Fc-receptor binding, we recommend blocking with normal serum from the host species of the labeled antibody (5% v/v). Other blocking reagents, such as BSA or commercially available blockers, may also be effective at minimizing background. </p>

            <h3>Controls</h3>

            <p>The addition of experimental controls will improve analysis of results and aid troubleshooting.</p>
